This module defines an API route for extracting and summarizing thematic insights 
from document embeddings using semantic search and abstractive summarization.

Routes:
- GET / : Accepts a query string `q`, retrieves top relevant document chunks using 
  vector search, and summarizes the collective themes using a transformer model.
